# Advent of Code 2021 solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/).
The solutions have been written with PHP and will be uploaded the at earliest
the day after the release of the puzzle.

Overall, my intention in Advent of Code 2021 has been to explore strict statically
typed PHP. The idea is to provide solution for each puzzle and conform to the
strictest static analysis levels of both Psalm and PHPStan.

## Usage

To list all the implemented tasks (i.e. solutions) run

```shell
./bin/console task:list
```

To run a specific task, use the following command

```
./bin/console task:run <taskname> [<input_file>]
```

Where task name is one of the codes provided by that task list, e.g "1-1" and the
input file option is the file to use for input (otherwise, the default provided in the
repository is used).
